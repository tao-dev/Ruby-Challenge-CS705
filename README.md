Ruby Programming Challenge For UNH students

RPCFN: Economics 101 - 13

As requested by Dr. Greene, I have posted my take on the Ruby Challenge issued by Dr. Bruce Scharlau. 

The goal of this challenge is to parse XML and retrieve key information located in the provided cia-1996.xml file. More specifically...

1. What is the population of the country with the most people? Yes, we know itâ€™s China, but just how many people lived there in 1996?
2. What are the five countries with the highest inflation rates, and what were those rates in 1996?
3. What are the six continents in the file and which countries belong to which continent? Can you also produce them in alphabetical order?

For those interested the full set of challenge instructions can be found here: http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/08/31/rpcfn-economics-101---13/
